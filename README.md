# My first web application - Blackjack

```
Blackjack is one of the most widely enjoyed casino games all over the world because of its simple rules.
Unlike other casinos, the dealer here is pleasant and may sometimes get a bit excited.
Please enjoy my game as long as you don't go broke!

## Notice for players

- Do not look at the code while you are playing the game if you do not want to lose the pleasure of playing it.

- Do not click the buttons many times, or the game would break.

- There might be a short lag after clicking a button.

- Use your computer or tablet, not smartphone.

- Please do not bring large sums of money. You'd go bankrupt!!

## Game specifications

- Split, insurance and even money have not been implemented.

- You can only bet in whole dollar amounts (each bet amount cannot exceed the amount of money you have).

- Double down is not allowed if you do not have enough money.

## Planning

- Potential problems

  - How to deal with Ace. Its value can be either 1 or 11 depending on the situation.  

  - In some cases, it might be better or necessary to have a pause between each process. For example, to produce an animation in which each card is dealt one by one.

  - There is a high risk of a bug if the player clicks any buttons while a process is being executed.

- Flow chart of app logic

## What I like about my game

- Single-page app

- Thousands separators

- A dealer who talks to you

## What was challenging

- To identify how to make the game work properly, and create the flow chart.

- To consider designs and implement features that can improve UX

- To identify the cause of a failure when my code didn't work as expected, even though there was no error message in the console.

## Bugs to fix

- So far no bugs have been found, but there may be some hidden ones.

## Future features

- Split, insurance and even money

- Casino chips

- Players can change some house rules, like selecting either H17 Game or S17 Game

- Available for multiple players

- Online playing for players who are in different locations

- Responsive design
